		 * When using npm link for testing, node modules become duplicated (including gulp). Because of this, gulp fails

		 * in this package. Therefore, this package ends up adding tasks to its own gulp instance, and gulp does not
		 * see these tasks, because it's looking at the gulp instance from the project.
		 *
		 * To combat this, we allow the project to pass in its own gulp instance to overwrite ours. If npm link was used,
		 * this resolves the issue with the duplicate gulp package. If npm link was not used, then the project's gulp instance
		 * will match our gulp instance regardless, so this assignment will be harmless.
